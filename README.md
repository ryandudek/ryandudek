# About Me

## Greetings

I am Ryan Dudek, a software engineer based out of (not always) sunny Philadelphia. I am passionate about building awesome and accessible user experiences. I consider myself to be framework agnostic, but have experience with many different development platforms.

Currently, I am a Senior Software Engineer (aka _Vice President of Keeping it Awesome_) on the Design System and Accessibility team at [MURAL](https://www.mural.co). If you are interested in learning more about me, check out my [resume](https://github.com/ryandudek/ryandudek/raw/develop/src/resources/RyanDudek-Resume.pdf). When I am not online, I enjoy the great outdoors, coffee, art, photography, cooking, baking, reading, and being active. Ask me about my many fake business ventures that are run by my pseudonym - Randy Duke.

So long, and thanks for all the fish,  
Ryan Dudek

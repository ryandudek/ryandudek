            <p class="rd-about-text">Iâ€™m Ryan Dudek, a software engineer based out of Ithaca, New York. I love building accessible user experiences using design systems to ensure reusability and to scale quickly, efficiently, and consistently.</p>
            <p class="rd-about-text rd-no-print">Currently, I am a Senior Software Engineer (aka <span class="italic">Vice President of Keeping it Awesome</span>) on the Design System and Accessibility team at <a href="https://www.mural.co/" target="new">Mural</a>. If you are interested in learning more about me, check out my <a href="/resources/RyanDudek-Resume.pdf">resume</a>. When I am not online, I enjoy the great outdoors, coffee, art, photography, cooking, baking, reading, and being active. Ask me about my many fake business ventures that are run by my pseudonym - Randy Duke.</p>
